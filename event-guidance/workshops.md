# Data Science CoP Workshops 

The Data Science Community of Practice (CoP) periodically leads or supports in-person and online data science training workshops to promote continuous learning in data science in the BC Public Service. 


### Some Resources for Delivering Data Science (Programming) Workshops:

 - [Ten quick tips for delivering programming lessons](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007433)
 - [10 tips and tricks for instructing and teaching by means of live coding](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/04/tips-tricks-live-coding.html)
 - [Tips for Teaching Online from The Carpentries Community](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/03/tips-for-teaching-online/)
 - [Lessons learned from running our first online workshop](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/14/first-online-workshop/)

### CoP Workshop Organisation & Delivery Checklist

- [ ] use & enforce a code of conduct  ([example](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/))
- [ ] use online registration  
    - advertise in multiple channels (e.g. bcgov Yammer, @Work, email, MS Teams)    
    - have & use a wait list  
- [ ] use a pre-course survey or [pre-course video-chats](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/17/unconf-sixtips/) with participants
- [ ] use a team teaching approach (e.g. possible formats discussed [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007433))
- [ ] consider supporting participants with computing environment set-up _before_ the workshop, or using/having a cloud-based alternative (e.g. [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb))
- [ ] include a helper/moderator to support workshop teaching team & participants  
    - manage video-conferencing tool  
    - trouble-shooting  
    - support technology issues  
    - oversee workshop timing 
- [ ] include an [effective ice breaker](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/17/unconf-sixtips/)
- [ ] carefully consider workshop content  
    - ensure the amount of material is appropriate for the allotted time (material _always_ takes longer to cover than estimated) 
    - [take it slow](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/04/tips-tricks-live-coding.html)
    - take [frequent breaks](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007433)
- [ ] use break-out rooms & [formative assessments](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007433) 
- [ ] open-source the workshop code and notes (e.g. online or in [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/ds-intro-to-r-2-day))
- [ ] capture the content from the day (e.g. chats, wiki, white boards)
- [ ] ensure participants know where & [how](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) to find community help/support _after_ the workshop
- [ ] include a feedback survey  
    - include an overall workshop assessment (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)
    - include an workshop organization assessment (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)
