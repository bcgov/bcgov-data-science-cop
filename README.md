# bcgov-data-science-cop

This repository is intended to house presentation materials from bcgov Data Science Community of Practice (CoP) and other related bcgov data science events. If you have participated in a bcgov Data Science CoP event and would like to contribute your presentation materials to this repository please open a pull request. Individual events are given their own sub-directory. Please contribute your materials to that sub-directory.

### Why?

To share practices, inspire each other & support continuous learning in data science in the BC Public Service.

### Resources

**Visit the [bcgov-data-science-resources Wiki](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgov-data-science-resources/wiki)** to find some data science resources for BC Public Servants.


### Meet-Up: `<bcgov/code_together>`

The Data Science CoP is hosting a monthly opportunity to code together for a couple of hours in an inviting, shared space in Victoria, B.C. We hope these sessions become a regular event where members of the community can meet some other coders in bcgov---in person or digitally---and ask and answer some questions, discuss data science approaches and tools, or simply hunker down with a coffee and get some coding done.
